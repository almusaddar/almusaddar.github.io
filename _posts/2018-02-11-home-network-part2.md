It's almost a year since I have wrote a blog post, I wasn't manage my time properly, so I'm willing to write more content from life and experience, back to the topic. I wrote a blog post about my network back in 2016, I have done a few enhancements to the network that I will talk about in this post, and few ideas that I'm planning to add to the updated network.
